So right now, I am using my custom GPT to push data and pull data. Push data is working, pull data is not working, I think, so I need to confirm. But how I am planning is, so mobile app is one, another is custom GPT, other one is the web engine, which has astrology, components, and also, when you said I exceeded quota, what I am trying or thinking or wanting suggestion is, I am going to have a LLM model, deep learning model, which is fine-tuned, I might download the open-source features or something, which you suggest, and try to train it based on the data we have, based on the data in the sense that they are birch details, and also I will be feeding the data, books, PDFs to the DeepSeek. So whenever I send from ChatGPT or whenever I manually enter in the site, it is going to generate the planetary positions in the database, and then the DeepSeek LLM model will pull from database and do all the learning, whatever I define. So do you think that's the best way of pulling data? Or is there any better interface specifically designed for AI readability? So in AI language, which will be easy for AI to understand, access, change, modify, read? Do you think? Reason is, right now we have GPT as a control, I'm building a web app which will have a components or interface or the ways to pull and push data with the proactive future vision. Right now we have ChatGPT, DeepSea. There might be anything coming up in future, but like network devices communicate with IP, there should be something which can be changed for AI. So that type of a format, if I make available in my web app, so I can switch to any different AI-related platforms or deep learning mode, anything in upcoming generation in technology, I can just link it. Like for example, I need a motherboard which has Thunderbolt 4 and also ready for Thunderbolt 5, 6, 7 or in future. Thunderbolt 4, 5, 6 is the interface, latest interface. And seeing the upcoming AI changes, AI is one platform, one way of handling, modifying, reading and studying data. So when that is doing that, there should be a specific way to feed data, specific way, method, type, format for AI to perform efficiently. And if we use the same method, form, way, parameter, if we incorporate that in our web app, in future, anytime we can straight away connect the AI and do anything with our data.wat do u think
