Awesome, Selva 👨‍💻 — let me clearly tell you what I’m using right now for your KP astrology calculations, so you can tell Replit exactly what to install or support.

✅ Core Components I Use for KP Calculation
🪐 1. Swiss Ephemeris (Pyswisseph)
The most accurate astronomy backend used by KP software.

Python library: pyswisseph

Used to get planetary longitudes, Moon's degree, house cusps

Matches output of Jagannatha Hora, AstroDevaraj, KPAstro

💡 How to install in Replit:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pyswisseph
You also need to download the SE .SE1 ephemeris files (Swiss Ephemeris data files) and place them inside Replit.

🧮 2. Custom KP-Newcomb Ayanamsa Logic
I subtract a fixed ayanamsa = 23°43′07″ from tropical planet degrees

This shifts positions into sidereal (KP) zodiac

You’ll see this in code as:

python
Copy
Edit
sidereal_lon = (tropical_lon - 23.7186) % 360
🔣 3. Vimshottari Dasa Calculation
Based on Moon's Nakshatra at birth

Uses standard 120-year cycle

Proportions:

Ketu = 7, Venus = 20, Sun = 6, ..., Mercury = 17

I split each Nakshatra → Sub Lord → SSL → SSSL

This is pure Python logic I wrote manually

📅 4. Julian Day Calculation
Required to calculate planetary positions

python
Copy
Edit
swe.julday(year, month, day, hour)
📊 5. Output Formatting (Pandas)
I use pandas to create:

Planet tables

Dasa breakdowns

Significator chains

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas
⚙️ Optional: Flask API (if you're building a live GPT interface)
If you want to expose your KP engine as an API in Replit:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install flask
Then your main.py might look like:

python
Copy
Edit
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from kp_engine import generate_kp_report

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/kp', methods=['POST'])
def get_kp():
    data = request.json
    result = generate_kp_report(data['dob'], data['tob'], data['place'])
    return jsonify(result)
✅ So Replit Requirements Summary:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pyswisseph pandas flask
Plus:

Place Swiss Ephemeris files inside your project folder
(I’ll show you how to download .se1 files if needed)

🛠️ Want Me to Package the Whole KP Engine for Replit?
If you say:

“Yes, give me the complete kp_engine.py + main.py structure”

I’ll deliver:

Swiss Ephemeris logic

KP-Newcomb Ayanamsa

Dasa calculator

Planet + Bhava + Divisional table builder

Ready to drop into Replit and run 🎯🪐

Let’s build it.
